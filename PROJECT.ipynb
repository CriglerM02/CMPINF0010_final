    "- My favorite neighborhood is good old South Oakland, but assuming you don't have a specific permit to park there, there are very few metered spots there which caused it to score low on that metric. I overall don't have much to say about this because I am still not too familiar with the many neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. I was still suprised that a neighborhood so downtown was the winner. Based on the data, though, I can trust that Strip District is the best place to park.\n",

    "- The best neighborhood to park in is South Side, South side has the most total transactions by a large margin which means there must be an abundence of parking spots for the people. Although South Side has the most tranactions, other data has pointed out that South Side has a disadvantage compared to areas like the Strip District. When combining the data from all of our data-sets, I believe that the Strip District is the best neighborhood to park."
